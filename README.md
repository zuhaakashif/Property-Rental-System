## Documentation

- PRE-BOOKINGS – Pre-bookings can be accessed by entering the ticket number which tells the user the details of a reservation that has been previously made. These details are stored beforehand in a dataset.

- CUSTOMER INFORMATION – After opting to make a new reservation, the user is asked to enter personal information such as their name, contact number, e-mail address and what type of accommodation they’d like to choose. This information is stored in respective datasets for future use.

- BUDGET AND GUESTS – Next, the user is asked what their budget is and the number of guests that will be staying. This data is saved and used in the next window.

- RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM – Keeping in mind the user’s budget and the number of guests, the program then recommends an appropriate type of accommodation from a variety of different options and asked whether they’re happy with the choice. The user is free to try this as many times as it takes to find a rental of their choice.

- ADDITIONAL FACILITIES – A range of additional amenities (such as Wi-Fi, room service etc.) are also offered which cost accordingly and are added to the final bill.

- DISCOUNT – A percentage of discount is also offered to users depending on how much they spend. For example, 5% if the total bill is over 5000Rs.

- BILL CALCULATION – The total bill is calculated by adding up the cost of the accommodation, additional facilities and the discount.

- BOOKING DETAILS – The user is shown the complete details of their booking which includes information such as their name, type of accommodation, contact number, booking number, total bill etc. The program can be reset and the user can make another booking by repeating the same process.
